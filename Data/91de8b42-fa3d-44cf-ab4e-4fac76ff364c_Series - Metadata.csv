per_si_allsi.adq_pop_tot,CC BY-4.0,Adequacy of social insurance programs (% of total welfare of beneficiary households),"Adequacy of social insurance programs is measured by the total transfer amount received by the population participating in social insurance programs as a share of their total welfare. Welfare is defined as the total income or total expenditure of beneficiary households. Social insurance programs include old age contributory pensions (including survivors and disability) and social security and health insurance benefits (including occupational injury benefits, paid sick leave, maternity and other social insurance). Estimates include both direct and indirect beneficiaries.","ASPIRE: The Atlas of Social Protection - Indicators of Resilience and Equity, The World Bank. Data are based on national representative household surveys. (datatopics.worldbank.org/aspire/)",Social Protection & Labor: Performance,Annual,,,,"When interpreting ASPIRE performance indicators based on household surveys, it is important to note that the extent to which information on specific transfers and programs is captured in the household surveys can vary a lot across countries. Moreover, household surveys do not capture the universe of social protection programs in the country, in best practice cases just the largest programs.  As a consequence, ASPIRE indicators are not fully comparable across program categories and countries; however, they provide approximate measures of social protection systems performance.  In addition, there may be cases where ASPIRE performance indicators differ from official WB country reports as ASPIRE indicators are based on a first level analysis of original survey data  and unified methodology that does not necessarily reflect country-specific knowledge and in depth country analysis relying on administrative program level data and/or imputations.",,https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by

Modern methods of contraception include female and male sterilization, oral hormonal pills, the intra-uterine device (IUD), the male condom, injectables, the implant (including Norplant), vaginal barrier methods, the female condom and emergency contraception. Traditional methods of contraception include rhythm (e.g., fertility awareness based methods, periodic abstinence), withdrawal and other traditional methods.","Household surveys, including Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. Largely compiled by United Nations Population Division.",Health: Reproductive health,Annual,Weighted average,"Contraceptive prevalence rates are obtained mainly from nationally representative household surveys, including: Demographic and Health Surveys; Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys; Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys; Gender and Generations Survey; Reproductive Health Surveys; and World Fertility Surveys.  Additional information was provided by other international survey programs and national surveys.  

Married women refer to women who are married (defined in relation to the marriage laws or customs of a country) and to women in a union, which refers to women living with their partner in the same household (also referred to as cohabiting unions, consensual unions, unmarried unions, or “living together”).","Contraceptive prevalence among women of reproductive age is related to maternal and child health, as well as gender equality and HIV/AIDS.   Contraceptives enable women and men to make informed decisions on family planning – whether, when, and how many children they would have. 

Preventing unwanted pregnancies is essential to reducing maternal deaths, especially in low- and middle- income countries where maternal mortality rate is high.  With effective contraception, life-threatening pregnancy complications can be reduced, and thus maternal deaths can be averted.  

Using condoms (one of the modern contraceptive methods) can prevent pregnancy as well as sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.","While the data availability on contraceptive use has increased, in many countries the contraceptive use data are available only for married women. 

The time frame used to assess contraceptive prevalence may vary. In many surveys, it is left to the respondent to determine what is meant by “currently using” a method of contraception.","As of December 2021, for better consistency the contraceptive prevalence data only for currently married women or in union are included in this indicator. It means the data for the following categories are excluded from this indicator: ever-married women; all women; sexually active women; which data may have been included in this indicator before December 2021. In response to this, two new contraceptive prevalence indicators (any method and any modern method) for sexually active unmarried women 15-49 are added to the HealthStats database. https://databank.worldbank.org/source/health-nutrition-and-population-statistics",https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by
